URLs are used to identify the location of files, web pages, images, videos and other resources on the web.    A typical URL consists of several parts, including the protocol, hostname, path and optional query parameters. For example, in the URL https://www.example.com/page?id=1, the protocol is \'https\', the hostname is \'www.example.com\', and the path is \'/page\' followed by a query parameter \'id\'.    When a web browser requests a URL, the domain name system (DNS) first resolves the hostname to an IP address. The browser then sends an HTTP request to that IP address to retrieve the resource. The web server at that address will return the appropriate content based on the path and parameters specified in the URL.    Below are some key components of URLs:    Protocol - The network protocol used such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP  Hostname - The domain name or IP address of the server   Path - The path to the resource on the host   Parameters - Additional key-value parameters attached to the path  Fragments - An internal page reference within the resource    By structuring URLs in this standard format, it allows resources to be uniquely identified and located on the web. URLs enable seamless navigation between websites, pages and resources across the internet."}]');
