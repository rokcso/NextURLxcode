URL is one of the foundations of the modern internet, allowing us to access web pages, images, videos, files, and other online resources through a simple text format. </p><p> URL consists of several components, each serving a specific purpose and functionality. Here are the main components of a URL: </p><p> 1. Protocol: The protocol specifies the communication protocol required to access the resource, such as HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), HTTPS (HTTP Secure), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), etc. The protocol is typically located at the beginning of the URL, followed by a colon and two slashes (e.g., http:// or https://). </p><p> 2. Domain Name: The domain name uniquely identifies a computer or network on the internet. It can be a hostname (e.g., www.example.com) or an IP address (e.g., 192.168.0.1). The domain name follows the protocol and is usually separated by a slash. </p><p> 3. Path: The path specifies the location of the resource on the server. It is a string separated by slashes, used to identify the directory structure or file location on the server. The path comes after the domain name and can contain multiple levels as needed. </p><p> 4. Query String: The query string is used to pass parameters and data to the server. It begins with a question mark (?) and is followed by parameters represented in key-value pairs. Multiple parameters are separated by an ampersand (&amp;). </p><p> 5. Fragment Identifier: The fragment identifier specifies a specific section or anchor within a webpage or document. It starts with a hash (#) followed by the name or identifier of the fragment. Fragment identifiers are commonly used to point to specific parts within a page. </p><p> Example of a URL: </p><p> Suppose we want to access an image named &quot;pic.jpg&quot; on a website called example.com, located at /images/ path, with parameters width=500 and height=300. The corresponding URL might be: http://www.example.com/images/pic.jpg?width=500&amp;height=300 </p><p> URL serves the purpose of identifying and locating resources on the internet. Through URLs, we can conveniently access various online resources, whether it&#x27;s web pages, images, or other types of files. Understanding the structure and components of a URL helps us better comprehend and utilize the internet.</p></div></main><footer class="layout_footer__WlhMu"><span>Online URL Encode/Decode Tool.¬†</span><span>Copyright ¬© 2023<!-- --> <a href="https://rokcso.com">rokcso üç©</a>.¬†</span><span>All rights reserved.</span></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"id":"what-is-url","title":"URL: Comprehensive Introduction to Uniform Resource Locator","excerpt":"URL: Uniform Resource Locator for locating internet resources.
