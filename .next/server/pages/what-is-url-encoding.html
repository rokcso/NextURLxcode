However, the web is a global platform, and different languages and characters are used worldwide. Unfortunately, URLs are not designed to handle all possible characters. Some characters, such as spaces, special symbols, and non-English characters, have special meanings in the underlying technology that powers the web. When these characters appear directly in a URL, they can cause confusion or even break the intended functionality. </p><p> What is URL Encoding? </p><p> URL encoding is a technique used to convert special characters, symbols, and non-English characters into a standardized format that can be safely transmitted through the internet. It ensures that the URLs remain valid and functional, regardless of the characters they contain. </p><p> The Principles of URL Encoding: </p><p> URL encoding follows a few fundamental principles: </p><p> Converting Characters to ASCII: To encode a character, it is first converted into its ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) representation. ASCII is a widely used character encoding standard that assigns a unique numeric value to each character. </p><p> Representing Characters as Percent Encoding: Once the character is converted into ASCII, it is then represented using percent encoding. Percent encoding replaces the character with a percent sign (&quot;%&quot;) followed by two hexadecimal digits that represent the ASCII value. For example, the space character ( ) is encoded as &quot;%20,&quot; and the question mark (?) is encoded as &quot;%3F.&quot; </p><p> Handling Reserved Characters: Some characters have reserved meanings in URLs, such as the ampersand (&amp;), equals sign (=), and forward slash (/). To use these characters as part of the actual content in a URL, they need to be encoded. For instance, the ampersand (&amp;) is encoded as &quot;%26.&quot; </p><p> URL Encoding in Practice: </p><p> URL encoding is automatically performed by web browsers and web servers when necessary. When you click on a link containing special characters or submit a form with non-English text, the browser takes care of encoding the URL before sending it to the server. Similarly, web servers decode the URL to retrieve the intended resource. </p><p> In Conclusion: </p><p> URL encoding is a crucial mechanism that enables seamless communication on the internet. It ensures that web addresses can handle a wide range of characters while maintaining their integrity and functionality.
